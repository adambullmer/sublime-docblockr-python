DocBlockr for Python
====================
Based off the [DocBlockr](https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs) project, This extension provides the similar funtionality but for python docstrings.
The default formatter for this plugin is designed around [PEP-257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) compliance but with more verbosity: Added variable types, listing class extensions, and listing decorators.
The main goal of this project is to help developer provide better documentation by giving easy and consistent formatting.


Installation
------------
**Manually**
Until this project can get onto Package Control, the only way to install it is manually.
1. Go to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/adambullmer/sublime-docblockr-python/releases/latest) and download the `DocBlockr_Python.sublime-package` file.
1. Move this file to your `Installed Packages` directory. (`Preferences > Browse Packages...` and go up one directory to see `Installed Packages`)
1. If you are updating your existing install, a restart of Sublime Text will be in order.


Usage
-----
There isn't a command pallete command to start this plugin, it is triggerg by hitting **enter** or **tab** after opening a docstring (`"""`) at the `module`, `class`, or `function` level.
If you wanted to simply put a new line after opening a docstring and not trigger the formatter, just hold `ctrl` and press enter.


Settings
--------
You can configure which docstring format to use by updating your user settings for this package. (`Preferences > Package Settings > DocBlockr Python > Settings (User)`)
For a full list of settings with documentation on what they affect, look at the `Settings (Default)` file.
You can also override your user settings on a per project basis by editing your project file. Any setting will be available for overriding here.

```json
{
	"DocblockrPython": {
		"formatter": "sphinx"
	},
	"folders": [
	    //...
	]
}
```


Supported Docstring Styles
--------------------------
- Docblockr (PEP0257 with types)
- [PEP0257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
- [Google](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html#Comments)
- [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt)
- [Sphinx (reST)](https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html)


Extendability
-------------
If you don't like the formatting styles above, or want to make your own style to fit your use case, you can write your own formatter.
All you will need to do is extend the [Base formatter](https://github.com/adambullmer/sublime-docblockr-python/blob/master/formatters/base.py#L32) class and write your formatter functions.
If you're not sure about it, you can take a look at any of the other formatters in the `formatters` source dir and see how they did it.
```py
from docblockr_python.formatters.base import Base


class MyFormatter(Base):
    # This will be used as your settings file value,
    # and how the formatter is registered in the registry
    name = 'my'
```

**Note:** The console should yell at you if you didn't write all the abstract methods. Be sure to read the docs on the `Base` formatter
to make sure you understand all the caveats of each formatter function.


Known Issues
------------
- Only detects closed docstring if it is on a line of the same indentation, and has no text in front of it. Single Line docstrings are converted to block


Roadmap
-------
Things I want to do wtih this project. Not necessarily an exhaustive or prioritized list.

- Unit Tests!
- More completions!
- Javadoc style formatter
- Keyboard Shortcuts
- Reparsing Docstring (switch templating style)
- Command Pallete Commands for changing syntax
- Dynamic completions based on chosen syntax
- Integration back with the original DocBlockr
- Better Syntax Highlighting within docstrings (in particular for other styles)
- Examples of each style to completion
- Documentation (isn't it ironic?)
